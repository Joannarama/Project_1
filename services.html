                <h2 class="orange-bar">Systems Integration</h2>
                <p>Separate business systems can be inefficient and time wasting.
                    Do you need your CRM to talk to your CMS? We can work with
                    you to build custom reporting from multiple systems across
                    your organisation and create custom System Integrations based
                    on your business requirements.
                </p>

                <h2 class="orange-bar">Bespoke Business Applications</h2>
                <p>As a company, have you ever tried to adapt a business process
                    to fit an off the shelf software package, but doesn't quite meet
                    all your requirements? Or do you have a spreadsheet that runs
                    your entire organization? Do you have a manual, time consuming
                    business process that ties up man hours to complete, and you know
                    could be more efficient? A bespoke business application may be the
                    best solution for the challenges you face. We can define, scope and
                    build a bespoke application that will save you time and money.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Content Management System is a software application or group
                    of interlinking apps that will allow you to add, edit, update
                    and delete the content on your website quickly and easily. We
                    work with many of the leading CMS systems from designing and
                    developing content architecture, template, custom plugins for
                    additional functionality and managing high availability deployments.

                <h2 class="orange-bar">White Label Software Development</h2>
                <p>If you have an idea of a software project you want to repackage
                    and sell on to clients, we can work with you to design and
                    deliver that package in line with your business needs and requirements.

                from Java, .Net, Python, Ruby and Node and PHP. We believe in picking
                the right stack for the project.

                On the frontend we work with a number of javascript frameworks including
                JQuery, Ember and React.

                For infrastructure and hosting, we pick the right environment for the
                project and work with providers such as Blacknight, Linode, Digital Ocean,
                AWS and Azure.
