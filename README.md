They may be at the early idea stage or have more particular requirements already thought out, the website will assure the user that whatever point they're at in their journey, we're here to support them. 

### User Requrements and Expectations

A clear, informative and easy to navigate interface
- Links and functionality that work as they would expect
- An easy-to-find means of contacting the company
- Accessibility



## Design
The current Devhaus website was built a number of years ago and the company has evolved from this point to the stage where the website is not in line with the current ethos and offerings of the company. 

Working with a Co. Wexford based designer in 2021, a new design was conceived to bring the site up to date and convey a sense of modernity and professionalisim in line with the company's current capabitities. 

### Design Choices

![alt_text](assets/images/readme-color-white-space.PNG "design elements")

The website design is a juxtaposition of strong accent colours with bold graphics based on the Devhaus branding and the use of white space which gives structure and clarity ensuring the content is easy to navigate, read and access. 
   
The calls to action stand out and attract the eye, encouraging the user to make a particular user journey to the contact us page. 

## Color Scheme
The color scheme is based around the orange devhaus branding and accented by a midnight blue. This creates the basis of the striking graphic imagery created by the designer for the site. White text is easily readable over these colours. 

The striking colours and graphics grab the users attention, creating an edgy, modern yet slick and professional feel. 

A light blue gradient background is used in two sections to further define particular areas of the website, these are the 'our Process' section and the 'Find us here' section of the Contact Us page. 

The gradient is subtle and it is used as a visual cue to define these particular areas without distracting the user from the content. 


<!-- - Final palette colours that were chosen were #F4F9F4 #C4E3CB #8AAE92 #616161 -->

## Fonts
The font chosen for this website is Quicksand. Quicksand is a very legible, modern font based on geometric shapes with rounded terminals. 

The font reflects the modern, edgy look and feel that the website aims to deliver.

### Images 

The image on the Contact Us page shows the location of Devhaus' physical office in Gorey, Co. Wexford and this image is owned by the developer.

### Structure

The structure of the website pages are intuitive and familiar and is user friendly and easily navigable. 

On the landing page, the user immediately sees the naviagtion bar and it is clear to see how the site can be used. 
    
The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A homepage with relevant company information, a high level explanation of our process, links to examples of completed work and calls to action to make an enquiry/contact the team. 
- A Services page outlining the various software development services and support offered.
- A contact page with a contact form, email and postal address and a contact phone number. 

## Wireframes
I based the design of this website on a wireframe PSD supplied by the designer. 

For the purposes of this project, the design has not been fully implemented, rather I have taken what I required from it to meet the criteria of this project for the Code Institute purposes and what I felt would demonstrate my competency for the HTML/CSS basics module.

## Features
The three individual pages contain the following features:

### Logo and Navigation Bar

The navigation menu bar appears consistently across the three pages and includes the Home, Services and Contact Us links.


It overlays the header image and has two design types. 

On the homepage and Contact Us page the font colour for the links are white as the header images on these pages are dark blue/navy. 
![alt_text](assets/images/nav-bar-dark.JPG "menu design 1")



On the services page, the header image is white and the links are navy. 
![alt_text](assets/images/nav-bar-light.JPG "menu design 2")

In both cases, the page the user is currently navigating will be highlighted orange in the menu nav bar. 


### Footer
The design of the footer is consistent across all pages and comprises two areas:
- The primary area of real estate which contains a striking, 'neon lights' style image and a call to action button encouraging the user to get in contact with Devhaus to discuss their potential software projects and ideas.

- The sub footer with contact email (clickable), Phone number (clickable), office location address as well as links to social media, i.e. Facebook, Twiter and Linkedin.

### Homepage
The landing page creates an immediate impact with a striking header graphic image and a clear, precise statement which delivers the message of what Devhaus does quickly. 

![alt_text](assets/images/readme-header-img.JPG "menu design 1")

The aim of the homepage overall is to build confidence in the user that Devhaus are a professional, skilled and diverse team of software developers, encompassing the user's full journey from idea inception and launch - and everything in between. 

In combination with the striking graphics and colour scheme, the content delivers clear and helpful information. 

An 'Awards' banner has been included in the design, showcasing a project which was the overall winner of the PProject Management Institute Awards in 2021. This again inspires confidence in the user that they are dealing with a professional, reputable company.

### Services page

![alt_text](assets/images/readme-services-img.JPG "Services")

The Services page is a cleanly designed page combining graphic images and text on a white background creating an easy to read program of services offered by Devhaus. 

The header text statement sums up our mission: *Custom software solutions to streamline your business operations*

The subsequent paragraphs outline the software services available to potential clients. 

The Technology Stack section of the Services Page describes the specialised range of technologies used by our team to create custom software. 





### Contact us

![alt_text](assets/images/readme-contact-form.JPG "Contact page")

The contact page is engaging with a vivid background header image and a clear, easy to read form to contact the company.

This page contains further useful contact information including the physical office location, contact email address, support email address for current clients and a contact phone number.
