Calls to action are placed in the header, main body and footer of the site to assist the user with straightforward navigation. The overall design and content of the site will build confidence in the user and they will gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's business. 

## User Experience

### Target Audience
The target audience are individuals who want to have software built usually to support their current business processes. They may visit the site via links on a search engine results page, through advertising, social media or from a back link on some online press coverage. They may be at the early idea stage or have more particular requirements already thought out, the website will assure the user that whatever point they're at in their journey, we're here to support them. 

### User Requrements and Expectations

A clear, informative and easy to navigate interface
- Links and functionality that work as they would expect
- An easy-to-find means of contacting the company
- Accessibility



## Design
The current Devhaus website was built a number of years ago and the company has evolved from this point to the stage where the website is not in line with the current ethos and offerings of the company. 

Working with a Co. Wexford based designer in 2021, a new design was conceived to bring the site up to date and convey a sense of modernity and professionalisim in line with the company's current capabitities. 

### Design Choices

The website design is a justaposition of strong accent colours with bold graphics based on the Devhaus branding and the use of white space which gives structure and clarity ensuring the content is easy to navigate, read and access. 
   
The calls to action stand out and attract the eye, encouraging the user to make a particular user journey to the contact us page.

### Colour Scheme

The color scheme is based around the orange devhaus branding and accented by a midnight blue. This creates the basis of the striking graphic imagery created by the designer for the site. White text is easily readable over these colours. 

The striking colours and graphics grab the users attention, creating an edgy, modern yet slick and professional feel. 

A light blue gradient background is used in two sections to further define particular areas of the websie, these are the 'our Process' section and the 'Find us here' section of the Contact Us page. 

The gradient is subtle and it is used as a visual cue to define these particular areas without distracting the user from the content. 


<!-- - Final palette colours that were chosen were #F4F9F4 #C4E3CB #8AAE92 #616161 -->


### Images 

The image on the Contact Us page shows the location of Devhaus' physical office in Gorey, Co. Wexford and is owned by the developer. 

<!-- insert image of Gorey Main Street -->

### Structure

The structure of the website pages are intuitive and familiar which is user friendly and easily navigable. 

On the landing page, the user immediately sees the naviagtion bar and it is clear to see how the site can be used. 
    
The website consists of three separate pages: 
- A homepage with relevant company information, a high level explanation of our process, examples of completed work and calls to action to make an enquiry/contact the team. 
- A Services page outlining the various software development and support offered.
- A contact page with a contact form, email and postal address and a contact phone number. 

## Wireframes
I based the design of this website on a wireframe PDF supplied by the designer. 

For the purposes of this project, the design has not been fully implemented, rather I have taken what I required from it to meet the criteria of this project for the Code Institute purposes and what I felt was approriate for the HTML/CSS basics module.
