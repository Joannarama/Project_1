            <h2>Bespoke Business Applications</h2>
            <p>As a company, have you ever tried to adapt a business process
                to fit an off the shelf software package, but doesn't quite meet
                all your requirements? Or do you have a spreadsheet that runs
                your entire organization? Do you have a manual, time consuming
                business process that ties up man hours to complete, and you know
                could be more efficient? A bespoke business application may be the
                best solution for the challenges you face. We can define, scope and
                build a bespoke application that will save you time and money.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Systems Integration</h2>
            <p>Separate business systems can be inefficient and time wasting.
                Do you need your CRM to talk to your CMS? We can work with
                you to build custom reporting from multiple systems across
                your organisation and create custom System Integrations based
                on your business requirements.

            <h2>Content Management Systems</h2>
            <p>A Content Management System is a software application or group
                of interlinking apps that will allow you to add, edit, update
                and delete the content on your website quickly and easily. We
                work with many of the leading CMS systems from designing and
                developing content architecture, template, custom plugins for
                additional functionality and managing high availability deployments.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2>White Label Software Development</h2>
            <p>If you have an idea of a software project you want to repackage
                and sell on to clients, we can work with you to design and
                deliver that package in line with your business needs and requirements.

            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>Our team of full - stack developers work with a range of technologies
                from Java, .Net, Python, Ruby and Node and PHP. We believe in picking
                the right stack for the project.

                On the frontend we work with a number of javascript frameworks including
                JQuery, Ember and React.

                For infrastructure and hosting, we pick the right environment for the
                project and work with providers such as Blacknight, Linode, Digital Ocean,
                AWS and Azure.
